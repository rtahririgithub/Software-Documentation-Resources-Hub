# Extended Warranty System (EWS) Enterprise Architecture Documentation Based on TOGAF Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an overview of the Enterprise Architecture (EA) for the Extended Warranty System (EWS) based on the TOGAF framework. The TOGAF framework is a methodology for developing and managing enterprise architecture, and it is divided into several phases, including the Architecture Vision, Business Architecture, Information Systems Architecture, and Technology Architecture.

- **Data Storage**: 
  - **Oracle Database**: Used for storing transactional data.
  - **Google SQL**: Used for storing EWS events.
  - **Google Pub/Sub**: Used for event-driven messaging.
- **Data Integration**: 
  - **Kong API Gateway**: Manages API integrations with internal and external systems.
  - **SFTP**: Used for file exchanges with vendors.

### 4.2. Application Architecture
- **Core Applications**:
  - **TD Commerce**: Handles commerce transactions for extended warranties.
  - **Koodo Selfserve**: Allows customers to manage their warranties.
  - **Asurion Enrolment API**: Integrates with Asurion for warranty enrolment.
  - **Apple Care API**: Integrates with Apple for AppleCare services.
- **Middleware**:
  - **WebLogic**: Used for application server management.
  - **Kong API Gateway**: Manages API traffic and security.
- **Third-Party Integrations**:
  - **Asurion**: Handles warranty claims and cancellations.
  - **Apple**: Manages AppleCare services and FMIP (Find My iPhone) integrations.

## 5. Technology Architecture

### 5.1. Infrastructure
- **Cloud Platforms**:
  - **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Hosts the EWS APIs, databases, and event-driven services.
  - **AWS**: Used for certain components of the system.
- **On-Premise Infrastructure**:
  - **TEN DMZ**: Demilitarized zone for secure external communications.
  - **TEN**: Internal network for TELUS systems.

### 5.2. Security Architecture
- **Authentication and Authorization**: 
  - **OAuth 2.0**: Used for API security.
  - **IP Whitelisting**: Ensures only authorized systems can access certain APIs.
- **Data Encryption**: 
  - **TLS**: Ensures secure communication between systems.
  - **Data-at-Rest Encryption**: Protects sensitive data stored in databases.
- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - **GCP Logs**: Used for monitoring and troubleshooting.
  - **Kong Logs**: Tracks API traffic and security events.

### 5.3. Integration Architecture
- **API Management**:
  - **Kong API Gateway**: Manages API traffic, security, and monitoring.
  - **TMF APIs**: Standardized APIs for resource inventory, catalog, and product management.
- **File Exchange**:
  - **SFTP**: Used for secure file transfers with vendors.
  - **Google Pub/Sub**: Used for event-driven messaging between systems.

## 6. Architecture Roadmap

### 6.1. Short-Term Goals
