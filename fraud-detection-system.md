## 1. The Problem

Telecommunication companies face increasing challenges due to hardware fraud losses during the subscriber activation process. Fraudsters exploit vulnerabilities to acquire high-end smartphones and other products undetected. Fraud rings walk away with high-end devices without paying, leading to significant financial losses.

### Key Issues:
- Fraudsters leverage stolen identities, synthetic identities, and various spoofing techniques to bypass security measures.
- Fraud hardware losses are growing rapidly, with an 83% increase in fraud incidents since Q1 2016.
- Fraud tactics are becoming more sophisticated, requiring advanced detection methodologies beyond traditional rule-based systems.
- Traditional supervised machine learning models struggle to adapt quickly to new fraud patterns.

## 9. Problem Definition

Telecommunication companies are facing significant challenges due to increasing hardware fraud losses during the subscriber activation process. Fraudsters exploit vulnerabilities in the system to acquire high-end smartphones and other products without detection. Fraud rings can walk away with high-end smartphones without paying, leading to substantial financial losses.

### Key Challenges:
- **Diverse Fraudulent Tactics:** Fraudsters employ a variety of techniques to manipulate the subscriber activation process, making it challenging to identify and address all potential vulnerabilities.
- **High-Value Targets:** The focus of fraudulent activities is on high-end smartphones and other valuable products, amplifying the financial impact of these fraudulent transactions.
- **Real-Time Detection Necessity:** Current fraud detection approaches are manual and reactive, lagging behind in preventing fraud in real-time.
- **Adaptive Fraud Patterns:** Fraudsters constantly adapt their strategies to circumvent security measures, requiring a dynamic solution to keep up with evolving fraud patterns.

## 10. Fraud Tactics

Fraudsters use various sophisticated tactics to exploit vulnerabilities within telecom companies, enabling them to obtain high-end smartphones and evade payment. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each fraud type and how fraudsters execute them:

### 1. First-Party Fraud
Fraudsters deliberately misrepresent their identity or intentions to obtain favorable terms or avoid financial commitments.

**Examples:**
- **Synthetic IDs:** Fraudsters create identities by combining real and fabricated information, such as a real Social Security number with a false name.
- **No Intent to Pay:** Customers subscribe to post-paid services or finance high-end devices with no intention of paying.
- **Straw Buyers:** Individuals manipulated by fraud rings use their identities to purchase smartphones on behalf of others.
- **False Disputes:** Fraudsters claim they were wrongly billed or did not authorize certain transactions to evade payment.

### 2. Third-Party Fraud
Fraudsters impersonate others to open new accounts or take over existing ones.

**Examples:**
- **Identity Theft:** Fraudsters use stolen identities to open accounts and acquire high-value devices.
- **Account Takeovers:** Fraudsters gain access to legitimate accounts and make unauthorized changes, such as upgrading devices.
- **Internal Fraud:** Employees misuse their access to create fake accounts or upgrade devices without authorization.
- **Manufactured Identities:** Fraudsters generate entirely fake identities to sign up for devices and services.

### 3. Subscription Fraud
Fraudsters use stolen or synthetic identities to acquire devices and services with the intent of selling them for profit.

**Examples:**
- **Stolen Identity Credentials:** Fraudsters use stolen credentials to open accounts, obtain smartphones, and leave bills unpaid.

## 11. Building a Fraud Detection Model

To build a fraud detection model that leverages data from a graph database on GCP, we’ll focus on combining **graph-based features** with **transactional data**. This approach uses relationships between data points (e.g., shared credentials, shared addresses) along with customer-specific attributes to detect fraud patterns that traditional methods might miss.

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Feature Extraction from Graph Database:** Extract features such as network centrality, community detection, and anomalous connections from the graph database.
- **Combining Graph Features with Transactional Data:** Merge graph-based features with transactional data, such as customer profiles, payment history, and blacklisted data.

### 2. Feature Engineering and Selection
- **Feature Transformation:** Encode categorical variables and create temporal features.
- **Aggregated Features:** Summarize patterns, such as the number of payment defaults in the past year.

### 3. Model Selection
- **Isolation Forest:** A tree-based approach for isolating outliers in high-dimensional data.
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Ideal for capturing relationships between customers and detecting fraud rings.
- **Autoencoders:** Useful for identifying deviations from normal customer behavior.

### 4. Training the Model
- **Data Splitting:** Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
- **Model Training:** Use Vertex AI Pipelines to automate training and evaluation.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using metrics such as precision-recall AUC and false positive rate.

### 5. Model Deployment and Real-Time Scoring
- **Deploy the Model:** Deploy the trained model in Vertex AI Prediction as a managed API.
- **Real-Time Scoring:** Use the API to score new transactions in real-time and trigger alerts for high-risk transactions.

### 6. Monitoring and Continuous Improvement
- **Model Monitoring:** Track the model’s performance using Cloud Monitoring.
- **Retraining:** Schedule retraining of the model using updated data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
